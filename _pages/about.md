I am a master student student at the [Industrial Engineering and Management](https://ieem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn). I also served as the summer intern at [Hong Kong University Of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn). I have always been fascinated by applied machine learning and its real-world applications.

My current research interests are High dimensional statistics for statistical process control, Bayesian causal inference and its application.

Outside of academics, my hobbies include music, jogging and traveling. Please feel free to send me an email if you want to make friends with me or discuss ideas.
