Welcome! I am a master student at the [Industrial Engineering and Management](https://ieem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn). I also served as the summer intern at [Hong Kong University Of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn). I have always been fascinated by applied machine learning and its real-world applications.

My current research interests are High dimensional statistics for statistical process control, Bayesian causal inference and its application.

Outside of academics, my hobbies include music, jogging and traveling. I tend to have rather imaginative ideas and thoroughly enjoy exploring novel concepts.
