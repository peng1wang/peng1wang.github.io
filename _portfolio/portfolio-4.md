title: "Spatiotemporal Prediction of Traffic Flow"
excerpt: "In this research, we employed several methods to forecast traffic flow. ARIMA and Wavelet-LSTM are used to describe temporal dependence. STARMA and CNN-LSTM are used to describe spatial-temporal dependence.<br/> <a href='https://github.com/peng1wang/Spatial-Temporal-Traffic-Prediction'> <img src='http://peng1wang.github.io/images/spatial-prediction.png'>"
