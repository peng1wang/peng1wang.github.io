title: "Density-LSTM for Probabilistic Power Curve Modeling"
excerpt: "Wind power curve describes the relationship between wind speed and wind power output, which is useful for wind farm design and wind turbine condition monitoring. This research proposes a novel probabilistic power curve named Density LSTM. In terms of input, the proposed power curve includes historical meteorological variables; in terms of output, the proposed power curve forecasts the probability density function of wind power directly.<br/> <a href='https://github.com/peng1wang/Density-LSTM'> <img src='http://peng1wang.github.io/images/image36.jpeg' width='100' height='100'>"
