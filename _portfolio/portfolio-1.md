title: "Density-LSTM for Probabilistic Power Curve Modeling"
excerpt: "Wind power curve describes the relationship between wind speed and wind power output, which is useful for wind farm design and wind turbine condition monitoring. This research proposes a novel probabilistic power curve named Density LSTM. In terms of input, the proposed power curve includes historical meteorological variables; in terms of output, the proposed power curve forecasts the probability density function of wind power directly.<br/>
