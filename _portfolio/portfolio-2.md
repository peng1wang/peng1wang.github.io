title: "Optimization of Automotive Painting Workshop Process Parameters Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning"
excerpt: "This research was my undergraduate project. In this research, I first proposed ensemble feature selection of a large number of sensor features in the painting workshop. Then, LSTM was used to forecast emissions of two kinds of pollutants from the workshop. Thirdly, I used DDPG to optimize the production parameters.<br/> <a href='https://github.com/peng1wang/Undergraduate-Thesis'> <img src='http://peng1wang.github.io/images/production.jpeg'>"
